# Doomsday Algorithm 

If you are a potential recruiter / employer checking out my Github page, I apologise. The aim of this project is not to maximise shareholder value, please check out my other projects. 
This is just a fun project of mine:)

Prof. John Conway devised an algorithm to find out the day of the week, give an input day, month and the year. Check it out here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule

To run this, simply download the python file, and input your desired date. It will output the day of the week for you.
