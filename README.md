# Doomsday Algorithm 

Prof. John Conway devised an algorithm to find out the day of the week, give an input day, month and the year. Check it out here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule

This python script did not make use of any built-in date libraries, it is purely algorithmic. 

To run this, simply download the python file, and input your desired date. It will output the day of the week for you.
